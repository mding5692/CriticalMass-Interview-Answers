Three pieces of software looked at:

IOS Swift Firefox browser: best practices, and state machines
PouchDB: How databases are made and how to handle data storage efficiently when offline
https://open.nytimes.com/building-a-text-editor-for-a-digital-first-newsroom-f1cb8367fc21: How collaborative CMS text editors are made - because I want to make something similar

## Inspiration:

- Firefox IOS Browser app (Link: https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios)
What I found inspiring: I was looking online for what a good IOS Swift mobile app looked like and was inspired by the Firefox Browser for IOS as it demonstrated good IOS mobile software architecture to learn from and also how to use state machines within individual parts of the app for much more concise and clear code.

- PouchDB, an open-source javascript database with offline capabilities (Link: https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb)
What I found inspiring: I've used pouchdb before and was wondering how you make a database internally so I learnt a lot about how a database works as well as inspired by the offline functionalities that pouchDB had.

- Building a Text Editor for a Digital-First Newsroom, blog post describing New York Times text editors for their writers, etc. (Link: https://open.nytimes.com/building-a-text-editor-for-a-digital-first-newsroom-f1cb8367fc21)
What I found inspiring: I've always wanted to build a collaborative online real-time text editor like Google Docs and so learnt a lot about the structure of one used by many in a production/professional surrounding and moreover learnt a lot about the tools one can use to build something similar to Google Docs.

## Focus:

I would focus my efforts on developing software that other software or apps use such as libraries or other components that apps use as I feel I am lacking in that field and that I'm good enough to put together ready-made parts to create an app but need more experience in making the individual parts.
